//Dynamic polymorphism (Function overriding)
// ðŸ‘‰ Derived class provides a different implementation of a function already defined in the base class.
// ðŸ‘‰ Achieved using the virtual keyword. it is achieved only by inheritance only.
// you can write the same function in both base and derived classes without virtual.
// That looks like overriding, but in reality, C++ treats it as function hiding, not true overriding and true polymorphism.
